## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- JavaScript



### What I learned

Working on this project allowed me to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using CSS Grid and same JavaScript. I was able to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and apply what I learned in real-world scenarios. As a result, I feel more confident and capable in using CSS Grid and JavaScript for future projects.
